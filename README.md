# fibonacciAlgorithms
Three algorithms to produce the Fibonacci sequence.
+ These three algorithms show that there is a difference in time complexity in different algorithms.
+ Try n = 48 with each one to see the difference.
+ fibv1 = recursive
+ fibv2 = array iteration
+ fibv3 = array iteration with pointers
